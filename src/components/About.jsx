        I'm Kerby G. Buan an Aspiring and motivated web developer with nearly four years of
        hands-on experience through academic and project-based development.
        Skilled in working with various web technologies and frameworks,
        including PHP, Laravel, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Experienced in
        developing user-focused interfaces including dashboards,CRUD systems and
        other interactive platforms.
        <br />
        <br />I enjoy developing simple, functional, and maintnable websites
        that solve real world projects.Also,Familiar with MVC architecture, CRUD operations, and RESTful
        concepts. <br />
        <br />
        Currently, I've been trying to learn React js to expand my knowledge of
        front-end libraries and improve front-end architecture.React’s
        component-based approach helps organize the codebase into reusable and
        maintainable components, making the project easier to scale and manage.
        This portfolio is built using React.js as part of my hands-on learning
        and practical application.
